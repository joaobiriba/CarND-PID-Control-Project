# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Reflection
The PID controller is made up of 3 components:<br>
P - Proportional: This component has the role of making the car "drifting" toward the CTE, by multiplying the CTE by P value (I find using Twiddle algorithm that 0.15 was a good value). However, it will never quite reach the CTE, but will oscillate around it. This will results in a not so-safe and (nausea :))  driving behavior.

D - Differential: This component has the role to add some feedback into the controller about how quickly it is moving back to the required path and compensate this movement. I used 0.001, taking it from Twiddle algorithm

I - Integration: This component has the role to integrate over the error and feed this signal back into our controller to compensate any drift in the vehicle. Drift can be caused by misalignments of the wheels.

### Twiddle discovering parameters
I used the "Twiddle" algorithm to tune the PID coefficients.
You can use `./pid twiddle` to run the Twiddle algo.

What the twiddle algorithm does is iteratively adjust the PID coefficients as the car drives, trying to find the best overall error.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!
